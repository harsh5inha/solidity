IMPORTING CONTRACTS
So we an import contracts into larger contracts. So contracts within contracts. Just like importing 
a module etc. Example in contract 1.1.

INHERITANCE
We can also inherit contracts, so that's when we create a contract that inherits all of the functions,
arrays, variables, etc. of a different contract. You basically initialize your contract as a type of a 
different contract. We do this by specifying:
`contract X is Y`
Example in contract 1.1.


To interact with a contract, you need the address, and you need the ABI.

ABI 
Application Binary Interface

When we actually initialize a new contract and store it in an array, the object that is actually stored 
is the address of the contract.
