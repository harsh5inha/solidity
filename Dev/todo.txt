These are topics that might be iteresting to do a deeper dive into in the future if there's more time.


Lesson 0
- MERKLE TREES 
- Lightning Network
- Sections 8-12 of the Bitcoin whitepaper


Lesson 7
- When do we specify public vs. internal vs. external etc.
- When do we specify view vs. not
- When do we specify "returns (uint256)" vs. not etc.


Lesson 10
- ZK ROllUPS 
- AAVE V2 vs. AMM MARKET  vs. AAVE POLYGON
- ADDRESS PROVIDER REGISTRY


Lesson 12
- The whole contract. We stopped doing the implementations because they were taking too long and I felt like I got the gist of it by this point.


Lesson 13
- The whole contract. We stopped doing the implementations because they were taking too long and I felt like I got the gist of it by this point. 
Actually, in the future I might consider actually going back and doing this lesson end to end. I Think by the end of it I'd get way better 
at React development, and I'd really be able to create a full stack React Web3 app. It'd take time definitely, maybe 2 full days. But 
I'd definitely build some muscle memory out of it. If that's something I want to do.
